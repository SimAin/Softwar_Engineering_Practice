Operator -> + 
    Can be used to add numbers and concatenate strings which previously we used to add numbers. 
    Operator is determined by the type of its operands.
    An operator which can work on different types is called an overloaded operator.

Casting 
    Allows implicit casting from a smaller-range numeric primitive data type to a larger-range one 

    int a = 1;  double b; b = a;
    will work.

    double a = 1.4; int b; b = a;
    will not - the compiler will warn that the incompatible dataypes will result in a lossy operation, i.e. the .4 will be lost.
    If you actually want to lose the .4 you need to explicitly cast.
    double d = 99.07;   long l = (long)d;

If v Switch
    The if statement tests one statement and chooses between two pieces of code based on the result. 
    Testing for a variety of possible values and take action depending on them: Called a multi-way conditional statement. 
    The switch construct allows us to do this by testing a value and executing statement(s) according to its various possible values.
    The switch statement only switches on a restricted range of datatypes: byte, short, char, int and String
