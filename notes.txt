Operator -> + 
    Can be used to add numbers and concatenate strings which previously we used to add numbers. 
    Operator is determined by the type of its operands.
    An operator which can work on different types is called an overloaded operator.

Casting 
    Allows implicit casting from a smaller-range numeric primitive data type to a larger-range one 

    int a = 1;  double b; b = a;
    will work.

    double a = 1.4; int b; b = a;
    will not - the compiler will warn that the incompatible dataypes will result in a lossy operation, i.e. the .4 will be lost.
    If you actually want to lose the .4 you need to explicitly cast.
    double d = 99.07;   long l = (long)d;

If v Switch
    The if statement tests one statement and chooses between two pieces of code based on the result. 
    Testing for a variety of possible values and take action depending on them: Called a multi-way conditional statement. 
    The switch construct allows us to do this by testing a value and executing statement(s) according to its various possible values.
    The switch statement only switches on a restricted range of datatypes: byte, short, char, int and String

Types    
    A named idea which can be defined with different values and supporting one or more operations is a type. 
    Java provides us with some built-in types (int, String, etc), but applications also need custom types. 
    E.g. Application selling flight tickets will need a type to represent a ticket. 
        A ticket could have values for the type of journey (air, sea, rail), start point, end point, cost, etc. 
        The ticket could support methods like checking if it was paid, cancelling a ticket and issuing a refund, etc.
    
Class
    A class can be regarded as a defining pattern or template of a type of object.
    Used to define an objects characteristics and behaviour.

Java Cons

    Verbose and repetitive
    Factory classes
    Writing Java when coming from another high level language feels like you are stuttering, it is very repetitive.
    Boilerplate
    Everything is a nail. The fact that everything is a class (except for the things that aren't) will give you a rough time of things once you really start trying to be tricky. 
        You can work around these with anonymous classes and reflection, but again, it's an extremely verbose way of doing things that adds more code which clouds the actual important code.

Rule of three 
    ("Three strikes and you refactor") 
    Code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored 
        Two instances of similar code don't require refactoring
        When similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.
